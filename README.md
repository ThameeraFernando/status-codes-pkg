# https-status-handler

A lightweight and developer-friendly utility package to access HTTP status codes by name instead of remembering numbers.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
npm install https-status-handler
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Import the `STATUS_CODES` object from the package and use the HTTP status codes in your responses.

### Using short messages

If you want to send a concise status message, use the `message` property:

```ts
import { STATUS_CODES } from "https-status-handler";

res.status(STATUS_CODES.BAD_GATEWAY.code).json({
  message: STATUS_CODES.BAD_GATEWAY.message,
});
```

### Using detailed descriptions

If you want to provide more descriptive information about the status code, use the `description` property:

```ts
import { STATUS_CODES } from "https-status-handler";

res.status(STATUS_CODES.BAD_GATEWAY.code).json({
  message: STATUS_CODES.BAD_GATEWAY.description,
});

---

## ðŸ§  Why Use This?

- No more Googling HTTP status codes.
- Code becomes more readable and self-documenting.
- Type-safe, easily accessible constants.
